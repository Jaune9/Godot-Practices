# Learning-Godot
GDQuest full From Zero To Code lecture (available here https://gdquest.mavenseed.com/lessons/what-you-ll-learn-in-the-course)

The free course available there https://gdquest.itch.io/learn-godot-gdscript was good enough for me to buy the full package
After 5 years developping, I have a strong basis, but not strong enough, and the free part already felt like an improvement of my own comprehension, far more than most academics I followed earlier. 

Give the free one a try, even if you don't care about game dev, it might surprise you with some knowledge.
