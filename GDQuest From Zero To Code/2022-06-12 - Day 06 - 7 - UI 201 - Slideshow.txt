Sumarize what you learn :

The connect() function has three required arguments:
- The signal’s name as a String.
- A reference to the node holding the callback function. Use self to connect to the node to which you attached the script.
- The name of the callback function as a String.

"""GDScript
# We get a reference to the HideButton node.
onready var hide_button := $MarginContainer/VBoxContainer/HideButton

func _ready() -> void:
    # The pressed signal exists on the Button node, so we need to call the
    # connect() function on the button.
    hide_button.connect("pressed", self, "_on_HideButton_pressed")
"""

==> The call to the connect() function reads as “connect the HideButton’s pressed signal to this node’s _on_HideButton_pressed() function.”

Godot users follow a convention to name the signal callback functions: 
_on_NodeName_signal_name()
but you can also connect to already existing functions.
