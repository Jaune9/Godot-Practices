Sumarize what you learn :

To create a Node from code, you have 3 steps :
You write the node type with its name followed by .new(). For example, Timer.new(), or Sprite.new().
You initialize the node to work the way you want using its properties, like Sprite.texture.
You add it as a child of another node with the add_child() member function.

Properly link to other nodes : 
You could do 
var scores_column: Node

func _ready() -> void:
    scores_column = $MarginContainer/VBoxContainer/ScoresColumn

To wait for $ScoresColumn to be ready, but it's bad practices. The proper way is 
onready var scores_column := $MarginContainer/VBoxContainer/ScoresColumn

Create and add nodes on demand

Added a child somewhere else :
$MarginContainer/VBoxContainer/ScoresColumn.add_child(row)
