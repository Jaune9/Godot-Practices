Here me out : With the gameplay loop we have, we can only do 2D... so we can do Terraria view or Pokeclicker view 
We also can zoom in/out depending on what we want 

Imagine you want to do a Rogue Legacy like dungeon, you can 
Imagine you want to do one big room, like a MH siege fight with activable and cannon and stuff, YOU CAN MAKE IT ONE FULL MAP
