When you fight with a weapon, you become better at this weapon type until you reach a moment where you can't progress for X units of time. 

From there, you can keep using it until the period ends, then continuing leveling it up. 

Or you can switch weapon type, get proficient with this new weapon, and come back to your other weapon type later. It's actually a good idea : When you don't use a weapon type for a while you lose a little proficiency with this weapon type (up to 5 or 10%, no more) but the more you forgot, the faster you'll learn and get back you X% and get the next one as well. Switching weapon type IS the best way to progress your proficiency, even if you want to main a weapon type.
