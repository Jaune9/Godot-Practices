The Smith and the Shopkeeper are a couple.
The Smith is a bold lady that likes going fast while the Shopkeeper is a bouncy man, quite slow, but very gentle.

They live in the same house, the Smithy and Shop entrance are just opposites entrances. 
They sometimes switch places, giving different mechanical pros and cons to each. 
For example, the Shopkeeper, when Smithing, can make something of a better quality.
On the other hand, the Smith, when selling items, can put an extra one on top! 

Giving life to NPC by mecanicals means is a way for all players to enjoy their personnality, not just the reader type :)
