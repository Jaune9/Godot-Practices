Sumarize what you learn :
UI can be streamlined as fuck, but are quite hard to learn at first
Instantiating new things with things.new()
Order of Instantiating matters and is tricky at first. Think in object, not in variables, and it will be ok.
You can't access a child of a node until that node got a proper reference to it. When you create the instance, before you added it to the scene tree with add_child(), its points_label and name_label are unset because they initialize on ready.

Summarize what you did :
Stylised a theme with margin, heritance and all. 
Spend hours trying to backlip my f*ing keyboard. 
Did a basic score system with 2 string on a line
Each line was a scene that I could instantiate on command
Manipulate scenes for the first time
FINISHED MY FIRST CHALLENGE WOOT WOOT

Write what you'll focus on during your next session :
Inventory Management !
