Sumarize what you learn :

    named_vector2.x = get_axis(x-, x+)
    named_vector2.y = get_axis(y-, y+) 
    direction = direction.normalized()
is equivalent to get_vector()

a simple steering algorythm :
    desired_velocity = max_speed * direction
	steering_vector = desired_velocity - velocity
	velocity += steering_vector * drag_factor

	position += velocity * delta
	if direction:
		rotation = velocity.angle()
