# I had (draining) obligations for a few days. 
# I still have them, it's just to not lose too much, not to gain much. 
# UPDATE : It seems it will be over by the end of the month ! Finally news on this. 
# UPDATE : It's never ending, but it's getting better. Can't wait until something like the 20th of July so it's over.

Sumarize what you learn :
The Singleton pattern is used to save the state of element between scenes thanks to autoloading 
All autoloaded Nodes are accessibles like so :
var player_vars = get_node("/root/PlayerVariables")
player_vars.health -= 10
or directly like a global variable 
PlayerVariables.health -= 10

Summarize what you did :
I didn't added music and animation so technically, 3D Squash the Creep is currently unfinished. 
I'm satisfied with what I learned tho, and intend on focusing on 2D. 

Write what you'll focus on during your next session :
