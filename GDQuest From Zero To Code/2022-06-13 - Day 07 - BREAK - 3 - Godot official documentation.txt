# Not the usual form, note taken on a trip

Followed tutorial up until the 2D game end, start of the 3D one. 

What I learned : 
export var thing # show thing in Godot UI 
clamp(min, max) exist in GDScript \o/

disabling the area's collision shape can cause an error if it happens in the middle of the engine's collision processing. Using set_deferred() tells Godot to wait to disable the shape until it's safe to do so. Ex:
func _on_Player_body_entered(body):
    hide() # player disappears after a hit
    emit_signal("hit")
    # Must be deferred as we can't change physics properties on a physic callback
    $CollisioonShape2D.set_deferred("disabled", true)


$AnimatedSprite.flip_h = velocity.x < 0

There's a vector math tutorial in the Godot Doc. 


What I'll focus on :
I want to try and do a little 20Min Until Dawn or Vampire Survivor like
