Write your learning plan :

- Why do you want to learn to code ? What's your goal ?
I want to learn to code efficiently because it makes me proud of myself and the strength I feel when coding probably saved my soul. 
I want to do Hunter Gatherer Clicker, a Monster Hunter x PokéClicker hybrid with ICRPG inspired mecanics.

- What will you get when you reach your goal ?
Drink water and learn all I can from GDQuest to gain in autonomy and sheer willpower!

- Where and at what time will you practice ? 
Daily, with exception when big game releases (looking at you MH Sunbreak and Monster Sanctuary DLC)

- For how long will you practice ? 
At least 30min

- How will you avoid distractions ?
No PokéClicker, No Mail, No Discord

- How will you stay accountable ? 
Discord and Reddit I guess ? It's the hardest part.
