Sumarize what you learn :

All control nodes share the same main properties:
- Anchor
- Bounding rectangle
- Focus and focus neighbour
- Size flags
- Margin
- The optional UI theme

For most games, youâ€™ll only need five types of UI elements, and a few Containers. These five Control nodes are:
- Label: for displaying text
- TextureRect: used mostly for backgrounds, or everything that should be a static image
- TextureProgress: for lifebars, loading bars, horizontal, vertical or radial
- NinePatchRect: for scalable panels
- TextureButton: to create buttons

TextureButton is TextureRect + texture slot for each state : Normal, Pressed, Hover and so on

The 5 most useful containers : If you build tools, you might need all of the containers. But for most games, a handful will be enough:
- MarginContainer, to add margins around part of the UI
- CenterContainer, to center its children in its bounding box
- VboxContainer and HboxContainer, to arrange UI elements in rows or columns
- GridContainer, to arrange Controls nodes in a grid-like pattern
