Sumarize what you learn :

PanelContainer stretches its children to fit the panel.
MarginContainer enforces a fixed margin on its children.
VBoxContainer arranges its children in a column.

So basically, putting 
PanelContainer
-> MarginContainer
    -> VBoxContainer 
Does a standard vertical UI. 

Summarize what you did :
Select tool active + Control Node == Layout in the top right corner. Efficient thing !
Did a basic naked scoreboard I'll populate with score labels next time (with code !)

Write what you'll focus on during your next session :
UI <3 
Dynamically create nodes with GDScript code
Load and instance scenes with code
Use dictionaries to create branching data structures
