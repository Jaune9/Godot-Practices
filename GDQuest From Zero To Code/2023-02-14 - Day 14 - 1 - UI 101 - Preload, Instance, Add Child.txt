Sumarize what you learn :

Did the GDQuest Practices in Godot to learn about UI with the Scoreboard exercices.
I learned about preloading, instance, add_child and using member methods. 

Summarize what you did :

A preload is a template, a kind of class. You need to instanciate it to use it.
To add a child node, you need to instanciate it from a preload : 

const MyClass := preload("ClassName.tscn")

func add_child_to_current_node():
    var myObject := MyClass.instance()
    add_child(myObject)
    myObject.member_method()
